## Why, hello there 👋

You've somehow stumbled onto the Github profile of me; [Brett Hutley](https://bretthutley.com).

Some random stuff about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on information mining using machine learning. Currently doing a lot of work to extract semantic information out of different file formats including PDFs. My plan is to improve everyone's life by presenting the information that people need, when they need it.
- 🐘 I'm the administrator of a Mastodon instance at [Natterai](https://natterati.com)
- 🏡 I currently live in Sydney, Australia. I previously lived in London, UK.
- ⚙️ I love automating things! To paraphrase Douglas Adams : "[I] am rarely happier than when spending an entire day programming my computer to perform automatically a task that would otherwise take me a good ten seconds to do by hand."
- I used to build algo trading systems for banks and hedge funds.
